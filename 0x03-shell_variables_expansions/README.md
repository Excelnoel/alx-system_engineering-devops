A shell initialization file is a shell script that runs automatically each time the shell executes. Initialization files help set up the shell environment for the user by defining things like:

Environment variables
Aliases
Functions
Prompt customizations
There are two main types of initialization files:

System-wide files: Apply to all users and are located in /etc. Examples include:
/etc/profile
/etc/bashrc
User-specific files: Apply to a single user and are located in the user's home directory. Examples include:
~/.bash_profile
~/.bashrc
The specific files read depend on whether the shell is:

Interactive: Reads commands from the user
Login: Executes under the user's ID after login
Non-login: Not used for login
Variables
Variables store data that can be accessed and modified during script execution. There are two main types:

Global variables: Can be accessed anywhere in the shell. Exported variables become global.
Local variables: Only visible within the current scope (function, script, etc).
To create a variable, use:

  VARIABLE="value"

Copy
To export a variable:

  export VARIABLE="value"

Copy
Shell Expansions
Shell expansions modify text before executing a command. Types of expansions include:

Parameter expansion: Expand variables using $VARIABLE
Tilde expansion: Expand ~ to the current user's home directory
Arithmetic expansion: Evaluate arithmetic expressions using $(( ))
Command substitution: Capture command output using $(command)
Brace expansion: Generate text using braces, e.g. {a,b,c}
Filename expansion: Expand wildcards like * and ?
